# Abstract

In this report, we will develop the mathematical theory and methods to discuss the convergence of infinite products. Moreover, we will supplement our discussion of infinite products with examples found in the text. We also will touch on Mittag-Leffler expansions. This theorem concerns the existence of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles. Specifically, we can use it to express any meromorphic function as a sum of partial fractions. Using these infinite series representations, we will compare them to the performance of Taylor series, and conduct judgments on practicality of Mittag-Leffler and infinite product series in graphing calculators. We found that these series vastly outperformed Taylor series, and would be very useful in graphing calculators.

# Numerical Results

Following our theoretical examples, we chose to analyze the performance of our Mittag-Leffler and Weierstrass Product expansions for sine and cotangent. In particular, analyze the computational cost and absolute error compared to their exact solutions. Using these errors and cost, we can compare the performance to Taylor Series to make engineering decisions as to how scientific and graphing calculators can better optimize their trigonometic function calculations. We determined that using Mittag-Leffler and Weierstrass product expansions are not only far less expensive, but also lead to much less error with proper iteration counts than Taylor series. This leads us to encourage the use of Mittag-Leffler and Weierstrass product expansions in modern calculators.
